PETALO_utils

MonteCarlo files have to be processed before used in pet_graphics or DAQ simulation
Use HF_processor customizing path and range of files to be converted

pet_graphics shows sensor distribution and renders amount of photons in event
Use ident option to show sensor numbers and show_photons to show number of photons detected
